# StackOverflow Search Data Over Time(2008-2020)

# Introduction

Hello! This repo contains a personal project of analyzing StackOverflow data over the years 2008-2020. The dataset contains the tags of questions asked/searched for as well as the amount of times. This project focuses on finding out what the most searched tags were over a specfic amount of time, IOS vs Android, as well as selecting specific programming languages/OS that you believe is popular and visualizing it to see if your assumptions are in fact true. 

# Questions :
1. What are the most searched for tags from the years 2010-2020?
2. Is the OS for IOS or Android tagged more?
3. Given a selection of perceived "popular" which is the most popular out of them all and is this expected or unexpected? 

# Data visualization/Descriptions

Based on the visualization, the programming language Python has the largest growth out of any other language from the year 2015-2020. It jumped from 2.2% of tags in 2015 to approximately 4.5% of all tags. Javascript remains about constant from approximately 3.8%-4%. Python seems to be the only programming langauge with a positive growth in terms of tags searched for in StackOverflow.

Given a set of 5 sample user-chosen programming languages, (java, python, r, scala, sql) it appears that Python once again has the highest growth rate out of any programming language. However, the programming langauge R has a slight increase in tag results from <1% to about 1% total tag results in the years of 2015-2020. Java is the second most searched for tag in the user-chosen sample averaging at approximately 2.5%

The age old question of is Android better or IOS better is settled by... The amount of tag results from StackOverflow of course. Given the graph shown, Android is consistently tagged more than IOS from averaging in approximately 2.2% for 2010-2020. IOS in comparison averages about 1.1% of tagged results from the years 2010-2020. 

# Conclusions 
1. The top 5 most searched for questions asked on StackOverflow is Android, C#, Java, Javascript, and lastly Python. 
2. Android is consistently tagged more vs IOS over the years 2010-2020. 
3. Given a selection of popular languages used in Data Science/backend work (Scala, R, Python, SQL, Java), Python has the most growth, Java has been declining, and SQL appears to be asked not as much as expected despite the prevalence in the Data Science world.
